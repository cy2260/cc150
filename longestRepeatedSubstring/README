Longest Repeated Substring

Given a string s, find the longest substring that appears more than once in s.

s = "abcabcaacb", return "abc"
s = "aababa", return "aba"
s = "abcd", return ""

solution 1, 
given a string with len = n, 
there are 2 substr with len = n-1, 3 substr with len = n-2, 
          4 substr with len = n-3, 4 substr with len = n-3,
	  ....
	  n substr with len = 1
we can check if there is a repeated substr with len=n-1, and then len=n-1 ... finally check each char

solution 2,
build a suffix array
check adjacent substring to determine the longest one
banana:
a
ana
anana
banana
na
nana
