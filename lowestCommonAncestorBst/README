Find the lowest commont ancestor of a BST

first node that is larger than or equals to val1 and smaller or equals to than val2 is the node

Both nodes are to the left of the tree.
Both nodes are to the right of the tree.

One node is on the left while the other is on the right.
OR
When the current node equals to either of the two nodes, this node must be the LCA too.
