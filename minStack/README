Design a stack which has a function min which returns the minimun element.
push, pop, top, min should all operate in O(1) time;

Besides the stack to store actual values, we need to have another stack to keep track of current mininum value.

when calling push(val), comapre val with minStack.top(), if val is smaller, push val to minStack. Otherwise, do nothing.

when calling pop(), comapre stack.top() with minStack.top(), if stack.top() is equal to minimun value, pop minimun value from minStack as well.
